## Game Prototype

In this prototype the player can control his spaceship using the keyboard.
There are 2 types of enemies which will spawn randomly (the higher the score, the faster they spawn) and try to destroy. One will shoot in a single direction while the other will shoot in two directions.

The player can destroy them in order to accumulate points and can be destroyed if their HP goes to 0. If this happens, pressing R will restart the game. Pressing Escape will quit it.
